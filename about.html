          <p>
            Created an Online Portal for exchanging and buying Books from
            different Users for a Startup called "BookFish". The Website uses
            Goodreads API to retrieve list of Books as search result. It also
            has features of User Registration & login through Social Media. I
            used Python based Django at the Backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript
            and Bootstrap to build a Frontend.
